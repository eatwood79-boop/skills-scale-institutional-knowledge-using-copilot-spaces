# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This collection of guides provides a comprehensive overview of how we plan, execute, and deliver projects across our organization. Whether you're new to OctoAcme or looking to refresh your understanding of our processes, you'll find everything you need to successfully manage and contribute to projects here.

## Project Management Approach Overview

At OctoAcme, we follow a set of core principles that guide how we work:

- **Customer-first approach**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision we make
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments that allow us to learn and adapt quickly
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead to ensure accountability and direction
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not just intuition
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback and learning, creating an environment where everyone can speak up and contribute

These principles ensure that our projects deliver real value while maintaining team health and continuous improvement.

## Core Project Lifecycle

Every project at OctoAcme follows a five-phase lifecycle:

### 1. Initiation
Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish a high-level timeline. This phase ensures everyone understands why we're doing the project and who needs to be involved.

### 2. Planning
Determine the scope, allocate resources, set milestones, and identify dependencies. Good planning helps us avoid surprises and keep projects on track.

### 3. Execution
Build, test, review, and iterate. Teams hold daily standups and use quality gates to ensure we're delivering high-quality work that meets our standards.

### 4. Release
Deploy the solution, verify it works as expected, and announce it to stakeholders. Clear communication ensures everyone knows what's been delivered and how to use it.

### 5. Close & Retrospective
Capture learnings, celebrate successes, and identify opportunities for improvement. This drives continuous improvement across all our projects.

## Key Roles

Successful projects require collaboration across multiple roles:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, tracks risks, and handles communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines desired outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals throughout the project lifecycle

For more detailed information about each role, see [octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## How to Use These Docs

### For Project Teams
- Start with the relevant phase document when you reach that stage in your project
- Keep the Project Charter updated in your project repository
- Reference these docs during planning and retrospectives to ensure you're following best practices

### For New Team Members
- Begin with the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our approach

- Explore the lifecycle documents to see how projects progress from idea to delivery

### Keeping Documentation Current
- These docs are living resources—suggest updates when you discover gaps or improvements
- Add project-specific process documentation to your project's `.copilot/` directory
- Connect your project documentation to Copilot Spaces so the AI assistant can provide context-aware guidance

### Using with Copilot Spaces
Add process-specific documentation into `.copilot/` in your project repository if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context for assistance with planning, execution, and problem-solving.
