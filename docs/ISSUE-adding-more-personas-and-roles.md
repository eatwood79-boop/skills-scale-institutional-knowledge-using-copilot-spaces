# [Process Doc Update]: Adding more personas and roles to the project management processes

## Which process document to update
octoacme-roles-and-personas.md

## Summary of New Content
Add comprehensive definitions for additional personas/roles that are referenced throughout the project management documentation but currently lack detailed descriptions. This includes:
- QA/Test Engineer
- Technical Lead/Architect
- DevOps Engineer
- Security Engineer
- UX/UI Designer
- Business Stakeholder

## Why is this update needed?

### Current Gaps
The current `octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` document only defines three personas (Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers). However, throughout the project management documentation, several other roles are mentioned without clear definitions:
- QA/Testing is referenced in execution tracking and project overview
- Security is mentioned in risk management
- Stakeholders are noted but not clearly defined
- DevOps practices are implied through CI/CD references

### Benefits of Adding These Personas

1. **Enhanced Clarity and Accountability**
   - Team members will understand exactly who is responsible for specific activities
   - Reduces ambiguity about role boundaries and handoffs
   - Makes it easier for new team members to understand the organization

2. **Improved Cross-Functional Collaboration**
   - Clear definition of how each role interacts with others
   - Better understanding of communication touchpoints
   - Reduced friction in handoffs between teams

3. **Better Project Planning**
   - Helps identify resource needs early in planning
   - Ensures all critical functions are represented in project planning
   - Improves estimation by considering all role contributions

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Ensures specialized roles (Security, QA) are not overlooked
   - Makes governance and compliance requirements clearer
   - Reduces the chance of critical gaps in project execution

## Potential Personas to Add

### 1. QA/Test Engineer
**Rationale**: Already mentioned in multiple docs but lacks formal definition. Critical for quality assurance and acceptance validation.

### 2. Technical Lead/Architect
**Rationale**: Important for technical decision-making, system design, and ensuring architectural consistency across features.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
**Rationale**: Essential for CI/CD pipeline management, infrastructure, and deployment automation referenced throughout docs.

### 4. Security Engineer
**Rationale**: Security is mentioned in risk management but the role isn't defined. Critical for security reviews and compliance.

### 5. UX/UI Designer
**Rationale**: User experience is implicit in "customer-first" principle but the design role isn't formalized. Important for product quality.

### 6. Business Stakeholder
**Rationale**: Stakeholders are mentioned but not defined. Clarifying this role improves communication and expectation management.

## How This Will Improve Project Outcomes

1. **Reduced Miscommunication**: Clear role definitions prevent assumptions about who does what
2. **Faster Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the team structure
3. **Better Resource Planning**: Project managers can ensure all needed roles are staffed
4. **Improved Quality**: Specialized roles like QA and Security get proper visibility
5. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Understanding interaction points between roles improves teamwork
6. **Clearer Escalation Paths**: Knowing all roles helps with issue resolution and decision-making

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Content aligns with existing process docs
- [x] Update improves clarity or closes a documented gap
- [ ] Proposed content has been reviewed with stakeholders (if needed)

## Suggested Content Structure

Each new persona should include:
- **Role Summary**: Brief description of the role
- **Responsibilities**: Key duties and activities
- **Goals**: What success looks like for this role
- **Typical Communication**: How they interact with other roles
- **Interactions with Other Roles**: Specific touchpoints with existing personas
